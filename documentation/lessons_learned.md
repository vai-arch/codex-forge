# Lessons LEarned

✅ First 5 minutes: Establish file locations

"Where is the code?"
"Show me directory structure"
"Which file are you executing?"

✅ Debug with data, not guesses:

"Put a breakpoint here"
"What's the value of X?"
"Upload the actual file"

✅ Follow the methodology:

Data first
One question at a time
No code until certain

✅ Token conservation:

Don't regenerate entire files
Don't re-read same code
One fix → test → next fix

✅ Trust the user:

They know their codebase
If they say "that's not it" → believe them
Ask clarifying questions
