As tapping the Choedan Kal unaided is invariably deadly because of the immense quantities of the One Power available through them, and the fact that carrying a gigantic statue is not feasible, the access keys were created both to act as buffers between the user and the sa'angreal while being portable.\n\nThree access keys have been found, two by Rand in Rhuidean and one alone, though there is a possibility that more may exist. The keys are shaped as small-scale replicas of their respective sa'angreal.\n\nRand and Asmodean fought for the male access key found in Rhuidean, with Rand emerging victorious. Lanfear also arrived in search for the female ter'angreal, but concluded that it was either not present or destroyed, although Rand recovered it intact.\n\nThis one known workable female key was destroyed during the cleansing of saidin, along with the female Choedan Kal. The male key was taken into possession by Cadsuane Melaidhrin after the cleansing. A damaged version of the female key was (and presumably still is) in one of the displays within the Panarch's Palace in Tanchico, first found when Egwene al'Vere went Dreamwalking to search for the Black Ajah. The Broken Female one is extremely dangerous to channel into, and even hurt Egwene just by touching it in Tel'aran'rhiod.\n\nAfter Rand banished Cadsuane from his sight, he had her room searched and recovered the male access key, which he then kept with him at all times, nearly using it for disastrously destructive purposes on several occasions.\n\nAfter traveling to the top of Dragonmount and realizing his madness, Rand draws every ounce of saidin that he can through the access key, and then pushes the power back into it, shattering the key and the Choedan Kal deliberately.",

The turning of this wheel and the events of each Age generate the Great Pattern, a predefined plan which defines the past, present and future.\n\nAn Age is a very long period of time. Ages are typically homogeneous, with beginnings and endings marked by dramatic changes and events. Each Age is a specific period of time whose basic design is defined by the Pattern of the Age. The pattern of each Age is fixed by the Great Pattern, but the details of a specific Age can vary considerably from the base pattern. The length of time from one variation of an Age to its next variation is long enough to completely erase all memory and records of the previous Age.\nInto each Age are born individuals who posses the ability to change the Pattern of an Age in either minor or major ways. These people are known as ta'veren, and can have a great influence on events of an Age. Although powerful, ta'veren are still bound to the Pattern of an Age, as well as the Great Pattern. It is theorized that ta'veren are created by the Wheel as a method to assure that the Pattern of an Age is woven properly.\n\nThere is some evidence in the books that we are living in the First Age, for example real-world references.\n\n- First Age\n- Second Age (Age of Legends)\n- Third Age\n- Fourth Age\n- Seventh Age",

Its use is to make oaths binding; that is, it is not possible to knowingly break an oath sworn on a binding rod unless the rod is used again to release the person from it. Binding rods are generally ivory-white and about a foot long with an archaic numeral engraved on it. The binding rod used by the White Tower as the Oath Rod bears the number three, while that used by Sevanna bears the number one hundred and eleven.\n\nBinding rods only work on channelers. Spirit is channeled into its end, and the channeler makes his or her oaths. The binder can also be used to remove oaths previously sworn on it, though this is very painful and few are aware of this ability. Oaths will also be removed when the channeler is severed.\n\nIf it happens that two oaths conflict, so that it is not possible to fulfill both, the channeler is rendered unable to breathe and will soon die if the conflict is not removed.\n\nSwearing oaths causes a painful tightening of the skin, which is responsible for the \"ageless\" look of Aes Sedai. Though Aes Sedai live extended lives, the Oath Rod severely shortens that life extension. Indeed when the Aes Sedai sworn her classical three oaths her remaining lifespan is halved. Conversely each time a channelers is freed from the oath by the binder or severing, his remaining lifespan is restored fully.",

They are the two most powerful sa'angreal ever created.\n\nDuring the War of Power, there were two plans as to how to defeat the Shadow; one was the plan supported by Latra Posae Decume, a female Aes Sedai of great strength and prominence to use the ter'angreal access keys to wield the One Power through the giant sa'angreal in order to defeat the forces of the Shadow and to erect a barrier around Shayol Ghul until a way to deal with the problem could be devised. Using the statues directly was impossible due to the massive amounts of the One Power and due to the difficulty of transporting them to the field of battle.\n\nWhen the access keys and the Choedan Kal were lost to the advancing armies of Sammael, Demandred and Be'lal, Lews Therin and the Hundred Companions felt they had no choice but to employ their alternative plan of sealing the bore.\n\nThe Choedan Kal remained unavailable until recently; the female statue is half-buried on the Sea Folk island of Tremalking and the male statue is being excavated near the village of Tremonsien, in Cairhien. Rand al'Thor first encountered the male statue while en route to Cairhien, following his trip through the Portal Stones. At the time, Selene (Lanfear in disguise), who was with him, panicked and berated Rand about his ignorance in the One Power when the allure of the sa'angreal makes Rand attempt to channel through it without one of the access ter'angreal.\n\nEgwene al'Vere (in Tel'aran'rhiod ), and then later Nynaeve al'Meara (in the waking world) found the top half of a broken female access key in the Panarch 's Palace in Tanchico, but it did not allow full access to the power of the female sa'angreal, and could potentially harm the saidar channeler attempting to use it.\n\nWhile in the Aiel Waste, Rand encountered the male and female access keys in Rhuidean. Rand discovered that Asmodean was in Rhuidean attempting to find an access key ter'angreal which he thought was there. Rand battled Asmodean for control of the key for the male part of Choedan Kal and it revealed that two men touchting the same key can channel through the sa'angreal at the same time, both controlling half of the power equally balanced. He could only won over Asmodean with the extra help of his fat bald man angreal. From this point, Rand had the two access ter'angreal in his possession. Lanfear tried to tempt him by saying a man and woman using the Choedan Kal together could challenge the Dark One, and maybe the Creator himself. It is interesting to note however, that Lews Therin believed that brute force could not stop the Dark One from breaking free, so the truth of Lanfear's statement remains to be determined.\n\nAsmodean discreetly referred to the sa'angreal as the only chance Rand has of winning the Last Battle. It was about this time that Rand began to toy with the idea of using the sa'angreal to cleanse the taint of saidin. Originally, he had planned to use Callandor for the deed, but after Cadsuane Melaidhrin informed him of Callandor's flaw, he realized the Choedan Kal were his last hope.\n\nDuring the Battle near Shadar Logoth, Nynaeve al'Meara and Rand linked outside Shadar Logoth, and tapped the Choedan Kal through the access ter'angreal. Rand was successful in cleansing the taint from saidin, but in the attempt, the female access key was destroyed as well as the sa'angreal itself. The male counterpart remained in Rand's possession. Some comments by Lanfear suggest the female counterpart could be used repeatedly if the channeler was as strong as Lanfear.\n\nThe statues glowed brightly during their intensive use to clean saidin (which appears to be typical behavior for a sa'angreal in use). The native people on Tremalking apparently saw the glowing female statue's orb as a herald to the end of the \"Time of Illusion,\" and shortly thereafter all of the island's inhabitants committed mass suicide.\n\nAfter Semirhage's failed attack on Rand using the Domination Band, he recovered the male access key and took to carrying it around, almost using it on Tuon and Seanchan holdings in the Westlands. Cadsuane considers this Rand's temptation by the access key, and its impact on Rand's psychology, the main reason for stealing Domination band from her box rather than from Seanchan. After Rand's fulfilment of a part of the Prophecy of the Dragon, he draws in as much power as he can through the sa'angreal and drives it back through itself, purposely obliterating it.",

    "description": "Compulsion is the name for the art of subjugating another person's will through the use of the One Power.\n\nThe lesser form of Compulsion is described like a whip, and makes the subject nervous and giddy, but the more advanced Compulsion compels the subject to worship the user. Both forms require using the Power to stimulate and control nerves in the brain, and forcing too hard can damage a person's mind permanently once they are released. Additionally, the greater the user's knowledge of the functions and anatomy of the human brain, the more effective their Compulsion becomes; this in part explains Graendal 's unmatched mastery of it.\n\nNormal use of Compulsion is to channel the Compulsion weave, often described as whip-like and making use of mostly Spirit, and then to issue a command. The victim will then carry out the command of the channeler. Through normal use, Compulsion is not thought to have any lasting effects. Repeated use on the same subject, however, can lead to the subject being more likely to be obedient, even if not under active Compulsion.\n\nSome people have the strength of mind to try and resist Compulsion subconsciously. If they are able to resist, they are then able to free themselves of the implanted command. This does not, however, protect the victim from a subsequent or more powerful use of Compulsion. Someone actively embracing the One Power cannot be placed under compulsion.\n\nIf one is commanded under Compulsion to commit an action that is an innermost desire, the command will persist for the remainder of that person's life. Conversely, the weaker forms of Compulsion have no effect on a person who is currently holding the One Power.\n\nCompulsion can be placed on a person permanently as well. By leaving the weaves tied off on a person's mind, their orders or even entire thoughts can be left by the channeler to stay with them until it is either lifted or they die. The more complex the Compulsion weaves, the harder it is to remove them. Lesser Compulsion can be lifted by an experienced enough channeler. However, extremely complex weaves literally end up taking the place of one's mind, rather than manipulating it, so lifting them evidently results in brain damage or death.\n\nCompulsion is used extensively by Graendal, and to a lesser extent by all followers of the Shadow with the ability to channel. Since strong use of Compulsion can completely remove a person's free will, it is forbidden from use by the current Aes Sedai.\n\nIt is often found that novices with the spark will have learned some crude form of Compulsion before coming to the White Tower. Normally, this type of Compulsion is simply an unintended prod on another person's mind in order to get something that they strongly want. These women are strongly disciplined and discouraged from using it again.\n\nRecently, Nynaeve al'Meara was able to learn how to work with those under Compulsion. She was able to lift extremely heavy weaves from the mind of one of Graendal 's victims. The youth was able to regain his mind for just a few moments in order give Rand and Nynaeve vital information before dying.\n\nThe female weave for Compulsion as used by Moghedien is described by Nynaeve as \"a complex weave of Spirit streaked by Water and Air\". The weave that she lifted from the aforementioned youth also consisted of these elements. A weaker form of Compulsion that Verin has discovered uses all five elements.",

    "description": "The Creator is the name given to the entity who created the universe, the Wheel of Time and reality itself. It is unclear if The Creator also created the Dark One; it is suggested that The Creator imprisoned the Dark One, its antithesis, at the moment of Creation, very probably in order to give his creations free will without allowing the Dark One to directly influence anything in the Pattern.\n\nVirtually nothing is known of The Creator. He is not worshiped as a god in the traditional sense, although his name and the term \"the Light \" appear to be interchangeable. By the Third Age it is common knowledge that The Creator will not directly intervene in the affairs of humankind. Consequently, there are no organized religious bodies that have anything to do with him, with the strange exception of the Children of the Light.\n\nDespite his lack of a presence in the Pattern, he may have spoken to Rand al\"Thor twice in the series. The first time is after Rand has first learned to channel after killing Aginor at the Eye of the World. In this instance, the voice remarked that it would not interfere, and that only Rand could undertake the struggle to help humankind. The second occurred immediately before Rand went to confront the Dark One at the Last Battle, when Rand was doubting whether or not he had prepared carefully enough for his confrontation with the Dark One. As Rand is about to step into the Pit of Doom, the same voice (as confirmed by Rand's thoughts) spoke aloud that the time for Rand to confront the Dark One was ripe.\n\nThe closest thing to the intervention of the Creator was through Nakomi, a woman of the surviving Jenn Aiel. Her purpose was to be the latest in a line of Jenn who acted as something close to a vessel or avatar of the Creator. Nakomi was not the Creator, but close to the Creator, and inhabited in part by something of the Creator.\n\nInterestingly, Rand hypothesized at one point that if the Dark One did break free of its prison then only that one world would be affected, not all of time and space (in contradiction of other prophecies ). He suggested that The Creator had created many worlds as a gardener had grown many grapes on a vine, and if one of the grapes shriveled and died, then the gardener would be regretful but would move on. Lews Therin Telamon, or at least the voice representing his personality within Rand's mind, seemed to agree with this conclusion.\n\nOne particular issue that the people of the world take with the Creator is that, despite the Dark One clearly being willing and able to meddle in the affairs of humans, the Creator is not. This is perceived by many, including a despairing Rand himself at one point, to have been an indifferent abandonment of humanity to a force of evil it cannot possibly defeat. It is only at the very end of the series that the reason for this is approach by the Creator is made, albeit indirectly. Due to the impregnable nature of the Dark One's prison, he ultimately has absolutely no power over reality outside of indirectly influencing humans to make evil choices. He only can directly touch the world if humanity, whether out of pride, hate, hopelessness or malice, allows him to. It was humanity that drilled into his prison in their arrogance, and humanity that wrought all the evils of the War of Power. It was ultimately humans, and only humans, that were responsible for the suffering that the Dark One is blamed for during the time the Bore was drilled to the time it was sealed again, and humans that ultimately managed to fix their mistakes. But due to the Dark One's inability to learn or change and the cyclical nature of time and history, the Dark One can't actually win unless humans permit him to by fully surrendering to him. Ultimately, it is entirely the choice of humanity whether to allow evil into their lives or not. The nature of the reality that the Creator incepted allows humans to make of the world what they will, for good or ill.",

Verin Mathwin thinks that she is unsurpassed at Delving. Nynaeve al'Meara also seems to possess this ability, allowing her to detect compulsion placed by Graendal on Lord Piqor Ramshalan, which allows Rand al'Thor to discover Graendal's hideout. Also, Nynaeve uses this to detect the madness of Naeff, Jahar Narishma, and Damer Flinn.\n\nAmong the Seanchan, Delving refers to the use of the Power by damane to search the earth for metal ores and such, and to extract the ores from the ground. This is a greatly sought-after ability for the Seanchan and damane who possess this Talent are highly prized.\n\nIt is thought that this was the traditional meaning of Delving, however as very few women have the talent, let alone sufficient strength in Earth, to perform this type of delving and the meaning has changed to mean to the talent described above. A reason for this could be that very, very few damane are used for healing due to their nature as possessions in Seanchan society.",

    "description": "Shielding is the act of forming a weave that will block another channeler from accessing the One Power, though the blocked channeler will still be able to sense it. During the Age of Legends, the weave was referred to as a buffer. The act of shielding is an incredibly useful tactic when a channeling foe needs to be subdued. It is a complex weave of Spirit.\n\nWhile any person who channels can lay a shield on another, if the one being shielded is much stronger in the power than the other, the shield can be broken through.\n\nA shield placed upon a person who can channel can be tied off and left, though such a weave can eventually be broken by someone with enough patience or pain tolerance. However, the more complex the weaves in the shield are, the harder it is for even another channeler to undo with the power. Shielding weaves can also be made semi-permanent if tied off expertly, but will still eventually break, so is not as final as severing.\n\nIt is possible to be exceptionally talented with shielding. An individual with this talent is able to hold a shield that even a much stronger channeler cannot break through. Instead of breaking, the shield stretches and bends. Berowin is the only person with this talent that is mentioned in the books, and while her strength is comparable to that of the weakest Aes Sedai, she successfully holds two shields on stronger channelers as Nynaeve and Elayne, and both at the same time. Berowin claims she would be able to hold a shield even on one of the Forsaken. Such talent with shielding is either unique to Berowin or extremely uncommon, as it seems Nynaeve was not prepared for it despite her time studying as Accepted; she considers it impossible. It is unknown if this shield will break eventually.\n\nTraditionally, to overwhelm the power of the strongest male channelers (the Dragon Reborn or some False Dragon ) a shield formed by the power of a full circle of thirteen Aes Sedai is needed, and a circle of six Sisters to maintain it.\n\nTo maintain a shield over the strongest female channelers a circle of two Aes Sedai is usually enough. However, in the case of the captured Semirhage, Cadsuane decided to always use a circle of three Sisters.",

It is the simplest form of Traveling, but while the ability to Travel is considered a Talent, the ability for Skimming is not and all channelers who know the weave can use it when the required strength is provided.\n\nSkimming is performed by opening a gateway to a pitch dark area where the user creates a platform, gets on it, and moves in any direction he or she wishes. If anyone falls off that platform, that person will fall forever and die of starvation or sheer terror, unless he or she can channel another platform to stop the fall.\n\nAs Skimming is a more indirect version of Traveling, the channeler does not need to know his or her surroundings and destination quite as thoroughly. Some familiarity with the area is still required, but it can usually be gained with only about a half hour of examination. If the destination is completely unfamiliar, the channeler can still use skimming, but must estimate the distance and direction and will not be able to open a gateway in any specific place.\n\nSkimming was first rediscovered in the Third Age by Rand al'Thor. It is mentioned in A Crown of Swords that unless two people attempt to skim with exactly the same start and destination, they will never see each other while skimming. This seems like it would make Rand encountering Asmodean while skimming to Rhuidean very unlikely, but he is Ta'veren after all.\n\nAmong female channelers, Egwene al'Vere holds the credit after discovering Traveling and then being taught the alteration by Moghedien, as knowledge of Skimming's existence hadn't survived to the Third Age.\n\nThe name may have come from the Age of Legends or Asmodean.",

The twisted redstone doorframes are a pair of ter'angreal of polished redstone. One doorway has three lines of triangles, points down, along each upright; the other has three sinuous lines running down each upright from top to bottom. These symbols allow the user to discern which inhabitants on the other side of the door they will interact with. The doorways look twisted and cause one's eyes to slip away before being able to tell how it connects at the top. Any person can step through the doorway, since channeling is not required, but they can use the ter'angreal only once. When the person steps through, they experience white light accompanied by a vast roar of sound. One is located in Tear, the other was discovered in Rhuidean.\n\nThe doorways provide protected access to the domains of the Aelfinn and Eelfinn, in the parallel world of the Finn. The Tower of Ghenjei in Andor can be entered by applying the rhyme from Snakes and Foxes, but this approach gives the entrant no protection from the wiles of the Finn. Aside from entering the Tower directly, the twisted redstone doorframes are the only known intersections between the human world and the Sindhol.\n\nIn this ter'angreal the user and the Finn are bound to an agreement. The petitioner can ask three requests from the Eelfinn or three questions from the Aelfinn and the Finn will always grant them…at a very high price. As well as the price, the Finn savor the petitioner's experiences and emotions and forge a mental link so they can harvest their experiences and memories when the petitioner returns to their own world. The petitioner must also abide by the treaties and agreements and carry no iron, instruments of music, or devices for making light. The petitioner must ask all three questions, and hear the answers before leaving. \"Frivolous questions\" are punished (the same question may or may not be frivolous depending on who is asking), and questions about the Shadow can have dire consequences for the petitioner.",

However, they are really outside the Pattern and can sometimes close up, or break off and drift away, leaving whatever is inside the vacuole gone forever. Time flows differently in vacuoles, sometimes slower, and sometimes much faster, though it's said that researchers had done great experiments in vacuoles during the Age of Legends. An example of a vacuole could be the Bore, in which the Dark One is held.\n\nMoghedien was held in a vacuole and punished by the Dark One for an unspecified period of time after her rescue from Salidar.",

    "description": "Vora's sa'angreal, once known as the white rod, is a female sa'angreal in the form of a fluted white wand. It was one of the most powerful sa'angreal in the White Tower's possession. The rod is kept in a storeroom in the Tower with other objects of the One Power, inside a narrow unadorned wooden box nestled in red silk. The wand itself is about the length of a woman's forearm, made of an unknown material that looks as though it could be bone or ivory, though it is neither.\n\nThis rod was used to Heal Matrim Cauthon 's affliction from the ruby-hilted dagger from Shadar Logoth. It was later used by Egwene al'Vere when the Seanchan attacked the Tower. It helped overcome the effects of the forkroot in her system.\n\nMuch like Callandor, which is attuned to saidin, Vora's sa'angreal lacks a buffer to protect the channeler from taking in too much saidar.\n\nLater on, as Amyrlin Seat, Egwene wielded Vora's sa'angreal in the Last Battle with great proficiency, destroying countless enemies in awesome displays of the Power. Her first engagement was with the White Tower against a vast horde of Trollocs advancing from conquered Kandor. The Trolloc army was decimated with relative ease, at least until the arrival of the Sharans. Towards the end of the Last Battle she faced Mazrim Taim, who had been renamed M'Hael and elevated to the rank of Chosen, and was also wielding a sa'angreal, the scepter Sakarnen. Refusing to use balefire like Taim, she found its counterweave, the Flame of Tar Valon, which she used to destroy Taim and nearly all of the Sharan channelers. Out of grief for her Warder 's death and exhaustion, Egwene drew too deeply of saidar and joined her weave, becoming a crystalline pillar, Vora's sa'angreal frozen at its center.\n\nThe pillar and the condition of the sa'angreal was discovered shortly afterwards by Leane Sharif. The Polov Heights collapsed toward the aftermath due to the enormous amounts of the Power that had been used on them, particularly the balefire. Vora's sa'angreal is presumably still buried beneath the rubble of the Heights.",

    "description": "A weave is a combination of One Power flows manipulated by a channeler to elicit a specific effect. During the Age of Legends channelers refered to the concept as a Web.\n\nThere are five different flows that can be manipulated with the One Power: Air, Earth, Fire, Spirit, and Water; these are known as the Five Powers. Each of the Five Powers produces a different effect when woven. For example, weaving Fire on a candle wick ignites it, lighting the candle. More complex weaves require more than one flow to be used, but produce more spectacular results.\n\nTheoretically, weaves of the One Power are similar to textile weaves, and weaving Saidar has been compared to folding silk. Once a weave has been created, the channeler can \"hold\" it to keep the effect ongoing, or knot the flows, a process called \"tying the weave off\". A weave that has been tied off persists even after the channeler has released the True Source or left the area.\n\nA channeler of Saidin or Saidar is able to see the weaves created using the same half of the Power, but not the other. For this reason, a man cannot teach a woman how to create a weave and vice versa. Although a channeler can intuitively create a weave (such as when Rand wove Balefire for the first time), most channelers learn by watching others create the weave. Once it has been created, they then practice creating it themselves until they can recreate it by memory. A channeler with the knowledge of how to invert their weaves can hide them from the sight of others.",

Far Madding 's Guardian is an example of such a ter'angreal that inhibits access to the True Source; Aes Sedai can only channel in Far Madding with the use of a Well. It can also be used to channel inside a stedding.\n\nThe only two known Wells are owned by Nynaeve al'Meara and Cadsuane Melaidhrin, both attuned to Saidar, the female part of the One Power. Nynaeve's Well is a belt and Cadsuane's Well is the golden hummingbird hair ornament in her paralis-net.\n\nThe Eye of the World was also functionally similar to a Well in that it stored within itself a great amount of Saidin (the male part of the One Power) purified from the taint, but it has been depleted and it is unknown whether it could potentially be refilled.\n\nWells appear to differ in terms of the amount of the Power they can contain, and it is known that Nynaeve's Well has a significantly higher capacity than Cadsuane's hummingbird.\n\nTo fill or refill a Well the user simply embraces saidar or seizes saidin through it as though using an angreal.",
